Textbooks on Cheminformatics & Quantum Chemistry strangle the subject to sleep üò¥ and command a wild price ü§ë for the naps they induce.

Want a better way to learn than some random repo on github? 

Spend 4-12 years of your life and hundreds of thousands of dollars chasing a paper with a stamp on it ü•á.

Or feed yourself üçº.

Information should be cheap, fast enjoyable, silly, shared, disproven, contested, and most of all free.

Knowledge hodlers, and innovation stifflers are boring and old. This is for the young chemists of mind and spirit üöº that are looking for cheap ways to mine gold.

> However, Nature often proves herself benevolent, and a [wave function](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_III_-_Optics_and_Modern_Physics_(OpenStax)/07%3A_Quantum_Mechanics/7.02%3A_Wavefunctions) representing a physical many-body system can
be typically characterized by an amount of information much smaller than the maximum capacity of the corresponding [Hilbert space](https://youtu.be/g-eNeXlZKAQ). A limited amount of [quantum entanglement](https://www.quantamagazine.org/entanglement-made-simple-20160428/), as well as the typicality of a small number of physical states, are then the blocks on which modern approaches build upon to solve the many-body [Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation](https://plus.maths.org/content/schrodinger-1) with a limited amount of classical resources.

# FermiNet

FermiNet is the implementation of the (2020) paper ["Ab-Initio Solution of the Many-Electron Schroedinger Equation with Deep Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02487.pdf)

It is a neural network for learning the ground state [wavefunctions](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_III_-_Optics_and_Modern_Physics_(OpenStax)/07%3A_Quantum_Mechanics/7.02%3A_Wavefunctions) of atoms and molecules using a [variational Monte Carlo](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00147) approach.

## [Base Config.py](https://github.com/deepmind/ferminet/blob/jax/ferminet/base_config.py)

The base_config.py file lets the user set the system and hyperparameters.

#### enum

The code begins: 
```python
import enum
import ml_collections
from ml_collections import config_dict
```

Simmilar to [enums in to C++ 11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum):
```c++
// color may be red (value 0), yellow (value 1), green (value 20), or blue (value 21)
enum color
{
    red,
    yellow,
    green = 20,
    blue
};
```

[Python enums](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html) introduced in  >= python 3.4 are a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant values:

```python
class NBA_ORG_RANKING(Enum):
  CELTICS = 7
  JAZZ = 4
  KNICKS = 31
  NETS = 1
```

FermiNet instantiates classes using enum. The code continues:

```python
class SystemType(enum.IntEnum):
  MOLECULE = 0
```
[IntEnum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.IntEnum) creates enumerated constants that are also subclasses of the [int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) class.

"Members of an IntEnum can be compared to integers; by extension, integer enumerations of different types can also be compared to each other...However, they can‚Äôt be compared to standard Enum enumerations:

```python
from enum import Enum
from enum import IntEnum

class Knicks(IntEnum):
  RANDLE = 1
  BARRETT = 2
  NTILIKINA = 3

class Nets(Enum):
  DURANT = 1
  IRVING = 2
  HARDEN = 3

print(Knicks.RANDLE == Nets.DURANT)
>> False
```
#### @classmethod decorator

The code continues: 
```python
class SystemType(enum.IntEnum):
  MOLECULE = 0

  @classmethod
  def has_value(cls, value):
    return any(value is item or value == item.value for item in cls)
```

The [@classmethod](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12179271/meaning-of-classmethod-and-staticmethod-for-beginner) decorator:

> "...take a cls parameter that points to the class‚Äîand not the object instance‚Äîwhen the method is called." [source](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)

> "Because the class method only has access to this cls argument, it can‚Äôt modify object instance state. That would require access to self. However, class methods can still modify class state that applies across all instances of the class." [source](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)

What we have here is the [factorymethod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern#:~:text=From%20Wikipedia%2C%20the%20free%20encyclopedia,object%20that%20will%20be%20created.) design pattern.

![chaplin](factory.gif)

```python
class Nets:
  def __init__(self, skills):
    self.skills = skills

  def __repr__(self):
    return f'Nets({self.skills!r})'

  @classmethod
  def Joe_Harris(cls):
    return cls(['3Pts', 'drives'])

  @classmethod
  def Nic_Claxton(cls):
    return cls(['D', 'jams'])

print(Nets.Nic_Claxton())
print(Nets.Joe_Harris())

>> Nets(['D', 'jams'])
>> Nets(['3Pts', 'drives'])
```

In this example we can create new Players of the Nets class configured with the skills that we want them to have from a single __init__ but many constructors. Now the class (cls) is the first argument rather than the instance of the class (self). 

> "Another way to look at this use of class methods is that they allow you to define alternative constructors for your classes. Python only allows one __init__ method per class. Using class methods it‚Äôs possible to add as many alternative constructors as necessary." [source](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)

### ml_collections ConfigDict

```python
def default() -> ml_collections.ConfigDict:
  """Create set of default parameters for running qmc.py.
  Note: placeholders (cfg.system.molecule and cfg.system.electrons) must be
  replaced with appropriate values.
  Returns:
    ml_collections.ConfigDict containing default settings.
  """
 ```
 
 Default returns a [mlcollections.ConfigDict]()
 
 > ConfigDict...is a "dict-like" data structure with dot access to nested elements...Supposed to be used as a main way of expressing configurations of experiments and models.
